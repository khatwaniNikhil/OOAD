| Signs to look - Code Review  | Pattern violated | Fix
| --- | --- |--- |
| Large classes which contain lots of functionality | Single responsibility principle | Break into smaller with data and behavior on data colocated |
| Long blocks of if/else statements that check an objectâ€™s type | Open/closed principle  |  use polymorphism either through interfaces or abstract classes |
| A Subtype Throws an Exception for a Behavior It Can't Fulfill | Liskov substitution principle  |   |
| A Subtype Provides No Implementation for a Behavior It Can't Fulfill | Liskov substitution principle  |   |
Subclass methods that enforce stricter rules on parameters than their base| Liskov substitution principle  |   |
Methods that appear from a signature point of view to operate on a base class (or interface) but then within the method some type checking occurs| Liskov substitution principle  |   |
large (fat) interfaces with a lot of unfocused methods| Interface segregation principle  | Break into multiple interfaces  |
Interfaces whose clients throw NotImplementedException() a lot| Interface segregation principle  | Break into multiple interfaces  |
lot of new statements or dependencies defined within method body | Dependency inversion principle | use container like spring IOC  |
